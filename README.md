# Learning Scala

Welcome to my Scala learning repository! This is my journey into Scala programming, where I’ll be writing and experimenting with Scala code for the first time. As I explore the features and capabilities of Scala, I’ll be sharing various projects, exercises, and examples here.

## Goals

- Familiarize with Scala syntax and semantics.
- Understand functional programming concepts in Scala.
- Explore object-oriented programming in Scala.
- Learn to use Scala libraries and frameworks.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shubhangdutta96/Scala_basicsAndEssentials.git
cd Scala_basicsAndEssentials
```

### You can customize this further to align it more with your specific needs or preferences!
#### Happy coding ❤️
