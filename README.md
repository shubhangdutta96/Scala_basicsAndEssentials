Learning Scala
Welcome to my Scala learning repository! This is my journey into Scala programming, where I’ll be writing and experimenting with Scala code for the first time. As I explore the features and capabilities of Scala, I’ll be sharing various projects, exercises, and examples here.

Goals:
Familiarize with Scala syntax and semantics.
Understand functional programming concepts in Scala.
Explore object-oriented programming in Scala.
Learn to use Scala libraries and frameworks.
